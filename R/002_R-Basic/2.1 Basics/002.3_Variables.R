#Variables
#Let's go over how to assign variables in R.

#You can use the <- character to assign a variable, 
#note how it kind of looks like an arrow pointing from the object to the variable name.

# Use hashtags for comments
variable.name <- 100

# Let's see the variable!
variable.name

#Working with variables
#We can use variables together and work with them, for example:
  
bank.account <- 100
deposit <- 10
bank.account <- bank.account + deposit
bank.account

#That's all for now, let's go learn about the basic data types!
