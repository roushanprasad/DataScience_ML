======================== Assignment 1 =================================
Exercise 1:
If x <- “Good Morning! “, find out the number of characters in X

Exercise 2:
Consider the character vector x <- c (“Nature’s”, “Best “), how many total characters are there in x?

Exercise 3:
If x <- c("Nature’s"," At its best ") , how many characters are there in x?

Exercise 4:
If fname <- "James" and lname <- "Bond", write some R code that will produce the output "James Bond".

Exercise 5:
If m <- "Capital of America is Washington" then extract the string "Capital of America" from the character vector m.

Exercise 6
Write some R code to replace the first occurrence of the word "failed" with "failure" in the string 
"Success is not final, failed is not fatal".

Exercise 7:
Consider two character vectors:
Names <- c("John", "Andrew", "Thomas")
Designation <- c("Manager", "Project Head", "Marketing Head")
Write some R code to obtain the following output.

	Names 	Designation
1 	John 	Manager
2 	Andrew 	Project Head
3 	Thomas 	Marketing Head

Exercise 8:
Write some R code that will initialise a character vector with fixed length of 10.

Exercise 9: 
Write a R program to create a vector of a specified type and length. 
Create vector of numeric, complex, logical and character types of length 6.

Exercise 10:
Write a R program to add two vectors of integers type and length 3.





======================== Solutions ====================================
Solution 1: 
nchar(x)

Solution 2: 
sum(nchar(x))

Solution 3: 
sum(nchar(x))

Solution 4:
paste(fname, lname)

Solution 5: 
//As we have not introduced higher concepts here, we will manually count and 
extract the values. However, note that this can also be done with a better 
and more efficient approach(es).//
substr(m,start = 1, stop = 18)

Solution 6: 
s <- "Success is not final, failed is not fatal"
sub("failed", "fatal", s)

Solution 7: 
Names <- c("John", "Andrew", "Thomas")
Designation <- c("Manager", "Project Head", "Marketing Head")
data.frame(Names, Designation)

Solution 8:
char.vec <- letters[c(1:10)]
char.vec

Solution 9:
x <- vector("numeric", 5)
c <- vector("complex", 5)
l <- vector("logical", 5)
chr <- vector("character", 5)

Solution 10:
a <- c(1,2,3)
b <- c(4,5,6)
a+b
