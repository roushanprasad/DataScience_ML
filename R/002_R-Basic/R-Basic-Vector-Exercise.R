#We will test you on a few topics:
# Basic Data Types
# Basic Arithmetic
# Vector
# Vector Operations
# Comparison operators
# Vector Selection and Indexing

#Solve the following problems using R

#What is two to the power of five?

#Create a vector called stock.prices with the following data points: 23,27,23,21,34


#Assign names to the price data points relating to the day of the week, 
#starting with Mon, Tue, Wed, etc...


#What was the average (mean) stock price for the week? 
#(You may need to reference a built-in function)

#Create a vector called over.23 consisting of logicals that correspond to the days 
#where the stock price was more than $23

#Use the over.23 vector to filter out the stock.prices vector and only return the day a
#nd prices where the price was over $23

#Use a built-in function to find the highest price
